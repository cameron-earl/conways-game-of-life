# Conway's Game of Life

The grid is alive... well, sort of.

Each square operates under a few basic rules:

* A cell comes to life if it has 3 living neighbors.
* A cell dies if it has less than 2 neighbors (starvation) or more than 3 (overcrowding)
* Living cells stay that way with 2 or 3 neighbors.

The result is a sort of simulation. You can watch populations grow and die. You can see stable populations develop that never change, cycle back and forth, or glide across the screen. If you're lucky, you'll see stable patterns that travel and create as they go.
